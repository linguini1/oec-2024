=== About the Competition ===
The task is to develop an adaptive learning system to accommodate individual student learning disabilities.

=== Super Readers===
Super Readers is a child friendly educational website that helps dyslexic students in grades 4 improve their reading
skills. The website is meant to cater to students with a visual learning style.

We used semantic HTML tags so that users with screen readers will have an easier time interpreting the content on the
page.

=== Technologies Used ===
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Python 3.11+
    - Flask
- tsParticles: [https://confetti.js.org/more.html]

=== Setup Instructions ===

These instructions assume that the user already has Python installed on their machine.

1. Install the required dependencies for this project by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   You may choose to install these in a virtual environment.

2. Run the main.py entry point using `py main.py` on Windows systems or `python3 main.py` on Linux.

3. Once the main.py file has been executed, the website will be hosted on your machine locally. Flask will display the
   URL where the website is hosted. If you open this URL in your browser, you will be able to navigate the site.

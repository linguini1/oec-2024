                <h2>About Super Readers</h2>
                <p>Dyslexia is a specific learning disorder. It is commonly seen as a reading disorder/disability. People with this disability struggle to identify speech sounds and connect sounds they hear to letters and words they see on the page. In addition, people with dyslexia often experience with other language skills, including spelling, writing and pronouncing words. One in five students, or 15-20% of the population, have a language-based learning disability. Super Readers is a child friendly educational website that helps dyslexic students in grades 4 improve their reading
                    skills. The website is meant to cater to students with a visual learning style.
